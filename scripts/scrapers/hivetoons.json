There are six races in this world: human, beast, dragon, elf, dwarf, and demon race. The human race is looked down and discriminated against in this world as the “most inferior.”Legion (the Race Union), is a party with various race members gathered to dispel such discrimination. But, they have a hidden purpose behind it. They were ordered by countries other than human races to search for “Master,” and take it under their own country. Light, a human boy, was welcomed into the Legion because of his gift “Infinite Gacha,” a gift that might be owned by “Master.” But in the end, their investigation showed that Light is not “Master.”Light was about to be killed by the Race Union members, but accidentally he steps on a “Transfer Trap.” As a result, he was teleported to the lowest level of the dungeon and escaped from Race Union’s members. In the deepest dungeon, he was attacked by a mythical demon of LV1000. In a desperate situation, Light hits the “Infinite Gacha” repeatedly.
